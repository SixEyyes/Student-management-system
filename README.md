School Management System (SMS) Requirements Analysis

1. System Goal

To create a secure, scalable, and multi-tenant software system capable of managing the administrative, academic, and financial needs of multiple independent schools.

2. Multi-Tenancy Requirements (Crucial for Multiple Schools)

The system must support the concept of "tenants," where each school operates completely independently.

Requirement

Description

School Isolation

Data for School A must be completely isolated and inaccessible by users from School B.

Tenant ID

Every user and data record must be linked to a unique School ID (Tenant ID).

Custom Branding

Schools should be able to customize basic elements (logo, color scheme) to match their brand.

Role-Based Access (RBAC)

Access control must be strictly enforced based on the user's role (Super Admin, School Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent).

3. Functional Requirements by User Role

A. School Administrator / Principal (Tenant Admin)

Module

Requirements

User Management

Create, edit, and deactivate user accounts for Teachers, Students, and other staff. Assign roles and permissions.

Academic Setup

Define academic years, semesters, classes/grades (e.g., 1st Grade, Class X), and sections (A, B, C).

Timetable

System to create, view, and assign class schedules and teacher allocations.

System Settings

Configure fee structures, holidays, grading scales, and school-level announcements.

B. Teacher

Module

Requirements

Attendance

Mark daily or period-wise attendance for assigned classes and view history.

Result/Grades

Enter marks and grades for tests, assignments, and exams based on the school's grading structure.

Class Management

View class roster, student profiles, and communicate with students/parents.

Lesson Planning

Manage and track completed/pending topics for their assigned subjects.

C. Student / Parent

Module

Requirements

Dashboard

Personalized view showing daily schedule, pending fees, and recent announcements.

Attendance

View personal attendance record (present/absent/leave count).

Results & Grades

View detailed report cards, marks achieved, and class ranking.

Fee Status

View outstanding fee balances, payment history, and due dates.

D. Core Modules (Financial & Academic)

Module

Requirements

Fee Management

Define fee categories, assign fees to classes/students, track payments, generate receipts, and manage refunds.

Reporting

Generate comprehensive reports (e.g., student performance summaries, fee collection reports, teacher workload).

Communication

Internal messaging system or integration with SMS/Email services for announcements and alerts.

4. Non-Functional Requirements (The 'How Well' of the System)

Category

Requirements

Performance

Must handle simultaneous logins from hundreds of users (teachers and students) without significant latency.

Scalability

The database and application architecture must be designed to scale for thousands of students and dozens of schools (multi-tenancy approach).

Security

Implement SSL, use strong password hashing, and ensure all data transmission is encrypted. Strict adherence to Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Usability

The user interface (UI) must be intuitive, mobile-friendly (responsive design), and accessible to all user roles.

Availability

Target 99.9% uptime (excluding scheduled maintenance).

Disaster Recovery

Implement regular, automated backups of all tenant data.

5. Technology Considerations

Hosting: Cloud provider (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS, Azure) to ensure scalability and global reach.

Database: A scalable, flexible database (e.g., Firestore/MongoDB for flexible document data, or PostgreSQL for complex relational data). Firestore is highly recommended due to its scalability and easy integration.

Frontend Framework: A modern framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js for a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) experience.

Backend/API: A robust framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/Flask, or Java/Spring Boot) to handle business logic and data security.
